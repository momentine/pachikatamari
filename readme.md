# Pachikatamari (パチ塊)

## Descripton 

Idea stemmed from a pun 

A 3D game that combines: 
- Overwatch's Pachimari (パチマリ, /patɕimaɺi/), a Japanese plush of a half-onion, half-octopus creature. 
- & Katamari Damacy's katamari (塊), a sticky clump that picks up objects. 

In this game, the player controls a Pachimari (which acts as the katamari) and rolls it around to pick up other pachimari plushies.

## Rules
1. Falling off the platform will result as game over, and the game will automatically restart
2. The more pachimari plushies that are picked up, the faster the katamari clump will roll, making it easier to roll around but more difficult to stay on the platform
3. The camera angle is still so be careful where to roll

## Code
